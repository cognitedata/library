# Migrate App to Flows Infrastructure

Orchestrates the full migration of a legacy Dune app to the new Flows app hosting (`appsApi`). Works through each area in order, skipping any already in the correct state.

## Step 1 — Audit current state

Read `app.json`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and `manifest.json` (if present).

Report a concise summary before making any changes:

```
Migration audit:
✗ app.json: missing infra field → will add "infra": "appsApi"
✗ Auth: DuneAuthProvider in use → will run setup-flows-auth
✗ manifest.json: missing → will create
✓ Deploy script: already uses @cognite/cli
```

Then proceed through Steps 2–5.

---

## Step 2 — Update `app.json`

If `infra` is already `"appsApi"`, skip this step. Otherwise:

**Fix legacy deployment key format first.** Many POC apps use `"deployment"` (singular, plain object). The CLI requires `"deployments"` (plural, array). If the file has the old format, rename the key and wrap the value in an array before proceeding:

```json
// Before (legacy)
{
  "deployment": { "org": "...", "project": "...", ... }
}

// After (correct)
{
  "deployments": [{ "org": "...", "project": "...", ... }]
}
```

Then add `"infra": "appsApi"`:

```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "externalId": "my-app",
  "versionTag": "0.0.1",
  "infra": "appsApi",
  "deployments": [...]
}
```

---

## Step 3 — Set up Flows auth

Run the `setup-flows-auth` skill now. It handles everything auth-related: package installation, Vite plugin updates, entry file changes, and wiring up `connectToHostApp`.

---

## Step 4 — Create or update `manifest.json`

The Flows host uses `manifest.json` to enforce a Content Security Policy for the app. It must exist at the repo root.

**Create if missing:**

```json
{
  "manifestVersion": 1,
  "permissions": {
    "network": []
  }
}
```

**Populate network permissions** by scanning for outbound calls to external domains:

```bash
grep -rn "fetch\|axios\|new XMLHttpRequest" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

For each group of external URLs found, add an entry to the `network` array using the `sources`/`directives` shape:

```json
{
  "manifestVersion": 1,
  "permissions": {
    "network": [
      {
        "sources": ["https://api.example.com", "https://maps.googleapis.com"],
        "directives": ["connect-src"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Rules:
- Use full origin (scheme + hostname) in `sources`, not just the hostname.
- `"connect-src"` covers `fetch`/`XMLHttpRequest`. Use `"img-src"` for image URLs, `"font-src"` for fonts.
- The CDF cluster URL is allowed automatically; do not list it.
- If no external calls exist, leave `"network": []`.
- Flag any dynamic URLs the user needs to verify manually.

---

## Step 5 — Update deploy scripts

Replace any `dune deploy` or `npx @cognite/dune` commands in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "npx @cognite/cli@latest apps deploy --interactive",
    "deploy-preview": "npx @cognite/cli@latest apps deploy --interactive"
  }
}
```

Keep all other scripts (`start`, `build`, `test`, etc.) unchanged.

---

## Step 6 — Final check

```bash
grep -rn "DuneAuthProvider\|useDune\|@cognite/dune" src/ vite.config.ts 2>/dev/null
```

List any remaining hits for the user to resolve. Then report:

```
Migration complete:
✓ app.json: infra set to "appsApi", deployments key is an array
✓ Auth: setup-flows-auth applied
✓ manifest.json: network permissions set
✓ Deploy scripts: updated to @cognite/cli
```

Then tell the user exactly what to do next:

```
Next steps:
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
2. Open Fusion and verify the app loads and CDF data appears correctly
3. When happy, deploy with: npx @cognite/cli@latest apps deploy --interactive
```
