CRITICAL RULES - Follow these exactly:

1. Hierarchy Completion Rate (CRITICAL - HIGH IS GOOD)
   - Target: >98%. This measures % of non-root assets with a valid parent link.
   - If <95%: Major issue - broken hierarchy links.
   - If 95-98%: Minor issue - some missing parent links.
   - If >98%: Good.

2. Orphan Rate (CRITICAL - LOW IS GOOD)
   - Target: 0%. Orphans are assets with no parent AND no children.
   - Any orphans indicate disconnected assets that won't appear in hierarchy navigation.

3. Depth Metrics (INFORMATIONAL)
   - Max Depth >8 levels MAY indicate over-nesting, but is not inherently bad.
   - Average Depth is informational only - varies by industry.

4. Breadth Metrics (INFORMATIONAL)
   - High max children may indicate flat hierarchies - not necessarily bad.
   - Standard deviation shows distribution evenness.

DO NOT:
- Flag depth metrics as critical issues
- Say low asset counts are problems (they may be correct)
- Suggest specific fixes without knowing the data source

FOCUS ON: Hierarchy completion and orphan issues that break asset navigation."""

CRITICAL RULES - Follow these exactly:

1. Equipment Association Rate (CRITICAL - HIGH IS GOOD)
   - Target: >90%. ALL equipment items SHOULD be linked to an asset.
   - Equipment without asset links cannot be found via asset navigation.
   - If <70%: Major issue. If 70-90%: Moderate issue. If >90%: Good.

2. Asset Equipment Coverage (INFORMATIONAL - LOW VALUES ARE OK)
   - This shows % of assets that have equipment attached.
   - LOW VALUES ARE ACCEPTABLE - not all assets have physical equipment.
   - Example: A "Building" asset won't have equipment; a "Pump Station" will.
   - DO NOT flag low values as problems.

3. Critical Equipment Contextualization (CRITICAL - MUST BE 100%)
   - ALL critical equipment must be linked to assets.
   - Any value <100% is a problem for critical equipment.

4. Serial Number/Manufacturer Completeness (INFORMATIONAL)
   - Data quality indicators, not critical for contextualization.
   - Nice to have for maintenance and procurement.

DO NOT:
- Flag Asset Equipment Coverage as a problem if low
- Assume all assets should have equipment

   - Orphaned TS break dashboards and analytics that filter by asset.
   - If <90%: Major issue. If 90-95%: Moderate issue. If >95%: Good.

2. Asset Monitoring Coverage (INFORMATIONAL - LOW VALUES ARE OK)

   - DO NOT flag low values as problems.

3. Critical Asset Coverage (CRITICAL - MUST BE 100%)

   - Any value <100% means critical assets lack monitoring data.

4. Data Freshness (INFORMATIONAL)
   - % of TS with recent data. Low values may indicate stale sensors.

5. Historical Data Completeness (INFORMATIONAL)
   - % of time with actual data. Gaps may indicate sensor outages.

CRITICAL RULES - Follow these exactly (based on maintenance domain expert guidance):

1. Work Order → Notification Rate (CRITICAL - MUST BE ~100%)
   - ALL work orders SHOULD originate from a notification.
   - This is the primary workflow: Notification triggers Work Order.
   - If <80%: Major issue - work orders created without proper notification.
   - If 80-95%: Moderate issue. If >95%: Good.

2. Notification → Work Order Rate (INFORMATIONAL - LOW VALUES ARE OK)
   - Many notifications do NOT need a work order - that's normal.
   - Example: Informational notifications, minor observations, already resolved issues.
   - DO NOT flag low values as problems.

3. Work Order → Asset Coverage (CRITICAL - HIGH IS GOOD)
   - Target: >90%. Work orders need asset context for proper assignment.

4. Work Order → Equipment Coverage (CRITICAL - HIGH IS GOOD)
   - Target: >90%. Work orders need equipment context for technicians.

5. Notification → Asset/Equipment (CRITICAL - HIGH IS GOOD)
   - Notifications need context for proper routing and assignment.

6. Asset Maintenance Coverage (INFORMATIONAL - LOW VALUES ARE OK)
   - Shows % of assets with maintenance records.
   - LOW VALUES ARE ACCEPTABLE - not all assets require maintenance.
   - Example: Buildings, land, infrastructure may not need maintenance orders.
   - DO NOT flag low values as problems.

7. Equipment Maintenance Coverage (INFORMATIONAL - LOW VALUES ARE OK)
   - Same as above - not all equipment needs maintenance records.
   - DO NOT flag low values as problems.

8. Failure Documentation Rates (INFORMATIONAL)
   - Important for reliability engineering but not all failures require full documentation.

DO NOT:
- Flag Notification → Work Order as critical (it's informational)
- Flag Asset/Equipment Maintenance Coverage as problems
- Assume all assets/equipment need maintenance records
- Confuse Work Order → Notification (critical) with Notification → Work Order (informational)
