# CDF Project Foundation Module

Provides the **project-level foundation** for the `dp:foundation` deployment pack: three persona-based access groups and a project setup wizard, aligned with the project-setup SOP.

---

## Deploying the Foundation Deployment Pack

### Step 0 — Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure the following are in place:

- **Cognite Toolkit latest** installed. Follow the [setup instructions](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_toolkit/guides/setup).
- A `cdf.toml` exists in your project root. If missing, run `cdf init` and choose **Create toml file (required)**.
- Authentication configured and verified:
  ```bash
  cdf auth init
  cdf auth verify
  ```
  See the [Toolkit authentication docs](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/deploy/cdf_toolkit/guides/auth).
- Library source configured in `cdf.toml`:
  ```toml
  [library.cognite]
  url = "https://github.com/cognitedata/library/releases/download/latest/packages.zip"
  ```

> **Important:** Keep all client IDs and secrets as environment variables — never hardcode them in config files.

---

### Step 1 — Initialise and download modules

From a clean Toolkit project directory, run the interactive module selector:

```bash
cdf modules init
```

Select **Foundation Deployment Pack** from the list.

---

### Step 2 — Select modules

The module selector presents all available modules. Make selections carefully:

**Data model** — select **exactly one**:

> ⚠️ **Select only one data model variant.** Selecting both will break auto-detection
> and require the `--variant` flag on every script run.

| Option | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `isa_manufacturing_extension` | ISA-95 / manufacturing assets |
| `cfihos_oil_and_gas_extension` | CFIHOS / oil & gas assets |

**Source system modules** — select any combination:

| Module | Source system |
|--------|--------------|
| `cdf_pi_foundation` | OSIsoft PI / AVEVA PI |
| `cdf_sap_foundation` | SAP (assets, equipment, functional locations) |
| `cdf_opcua_foundation` | OPC-UA |
| `cdf_db_foundation` | Generic database (PostgreSQL, etc.) |
| `cdf_files_foundation` | File sources (SharePoint, etc.) |

**Contextualization modules** — optional:

| Module | Capability |
|--------|-----------|
| `cdf_entity_matching` | Automated asset–time series matching |
| `cdf_file_annotation` | P&ID / document annotation |

**Common module** — always include:

- `cdf_project_foundation` ← this module (access groups + setup wizard)

**Project health** — optional:

- `qualitizer` ← data quality monitoring tool

---

### Step 3 — Run the setup wizard

From the Toolkit project root, run the interactive setup wizard. It prompts for CDF project names, site/location, Entra ID group source IDs, source system owner contacts, and ApplicationOwner (if file annotation is installed), then writes all `config.<env>.yaml` files and `.env` in one pass:

```bash
python modules/common/cdf_project_foundation/scripts/setup_project.py
```

The wizard is **idempotent** — re-running it pre-fills every prompt with the current values so you can update individual fields without re-entering everything.

For non-interactive use (e.g. onboarding scripts), skip the confirmation prompt with `-y`:

```bash
python modules/common/cdf_project_foundation/scripts/setup_project.py -y
```

Other options:

```bash
python modules/common/cdf_project_foundation/scripts/setup_project.py -y --variant isa_manufacturing_extension
python modules/common/cdf_project_foundation/scripts/setup_project.py -y --site oslo
python modules/common/cdf_project_foundation/scripts/setup_project.py --check   # CI drift check
```

> When more than one data model directory exists under `modules/data_models/` (as in
> this catalog repo), auto-detection cannot pick one — pass `--variant` explicitly.
> A real deployment pack contains exactly one model directory.

---

### Step 4 — Build and validate with a dry-run

Run a build and dry-run to catch config errors before touching any live CDF project:

```bash
cdf build --env dev
cdf deploy --env dev --dry-run
```

Repeat for `test` and `prod` as needed. Fix any reported issues and re-run.

---

### Step 5 — Deploy

Once the dry-run is clean, deploy to your project:

```bash
cdf deploy --env dev
```

---

### Step 6 — Set up CI/CD (optional)

Generate GitHub Actions workflows that automate build, dry-run, and deploy on PR / merge / release. This can also be triggered through the setup wizard (Step 3):

```bash
python modules/common/cdf_project_foundation/scripts/generate_actions.py --force
```

Set `enterprise` in `cdf.toml` under `[cdf]` (e.g. `enterprise = "acme"`) or pass `--enterprise <slug>` to override. The script reads `org-dir` and toolkit version from `cdf.toml` automatically.

This writes `.github/workflows/` (`dry-run.yml`, `deploy-dev.yml`, `deploy-test.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`) and `docs/FOUNDATION_CICD.md` (GitHub Environments and secrets).

Branching model: PRs to `dev` / `main`; deploy **dev** on merge to `dev`, **test** on merge to `main`, **prod** on GitHub Release from `main`.

## Access Groups

Three CDF groups are deployed, each bound to an Entra ID security group via its `sourceId` (the Entra ID group **Object ID**, recorded per SOP Step 3d). Naming follows the **SOP**:

```
<persona>-[site]-<environment>
```

- `persona` (required): `consumer` | `producer` | `admin`
- `site` (optional): e.g. `oslo` — set via the site / location prompt in the wizard
- `environment` (required): `dev` (covers **dev + test**) | `prod`

| Group | Name (example) | Persona | Capability scope |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| `consumer.Group.yaml` | `consumer-dev` / `consumer-prod` | Read-only | READ on data models / instances / timeseries / files / RAW / transformations, scoped to `{{ dataset }}` / `{{ instanceSpace }}` / `{{ schemaSpace }}` |
| `producer.Group.yaml` | `producer-dev` / `producer-prod` | Read/write | Consumer rights plus WRITE to instances / timeseries / files / RAW, run transformations, workflow orchestration, sessions CREATE |
| `admin.Group.yaml` | `admin-dev` / `admin-prod` | Admin | Full capabilities including `groups:write`, projects, datasets, data models, transformations, workflows, extraction pipelines |

The wizard stores group source IDs in `.env` as `CONSUMER_SOURCE_ID`, `PRODUCER_SOURCE_ID`, `ADMIN_SOURCE_ID` and the config files reference them via `${…}`. These are Entra ID object IDs, **not secrets**.

> **Service-principal / per-extractor groups**: This module ships only the three core persona groups. Additional producer groups for service principals and extractors are added per SOP Step 3c as concrete needs arise.

---

## Project Setup Wizard — Reference

The wizard (`scripts/setup_project.py`) is split across four helper modules:

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `_style.py` | ANSI colours, section headers, `_ok` / `_warn` / `_hint`, changes table |
| `_prompts.py` | `prompt`, `prompt_yes_no`, `prompt_choice`, `prompt_env_var` |
| `_env_io.py` | `.env` file parse and upsert helpers |
| `_yaml_patch.py` | Line-preserving YAML scalar patcher (preserves comments and blank lines) |

### Wizard flow

1. Prompts for which environments to set up (all three, dev only, dev+prod, or custom).
2. Asks for the CDF project name for each selected environment (pre-filled on re-run).
3. Asks for an optional site / location name — used as access-group suffix and entity-matching `location_name`.
4. Prompts for source system integration and data owner contacts (shared or per-module).
5. Prompts for group source IDs (Entra ID object IDs) and writes them to `.env`.
6. Asks for the Streamlit ApplicationOwner email if `cdf_file_annotation` is installed.
7. Shows a review summary then confirms before writing anything.
8. Creates new config files or updates existing ones in-place (preserving comments).
9. Removes redundant auth files from contextualization and tools modules covered by the foundation.
10. Optionally generates GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows.

| Env key | Maps to | Config file |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `dev` | Development | `config.dev.yaml` |
| `test` | Test / Staging | `config.test.yaml` |
| `prod` | Production | `config.prod.yaml` |

---

## Configuration

```yaml
# default.config.yaml — key variables (populated by the wizard)
site: ""                                   # optional site segment for group names
dataset: []                                # auto-populated from installed source system modules
schemaSpace: "sp_isa_manufacturing"        # synced from the installed data model variant
instanceSpace: "sp_isa_instance_space"
dataModelVariant: isa_manufacturing_extension

# Computed per env by setup_project.py:
consumerGroupName: "consumer-dev"
producerGroupName: "producer-dev"
adminGroupName: "admin-dev"

# Entra ID group object IDs — stored in .env, referenced here via ${…}:
consumerSourceId: "${CONSUMER_SOURCE_ID}"
producerSourceId: "${PRODUCER_SOURCE_ID}"
adminSourceId: "${ADMIN_SOURCE_ID}"
```

---

## Dependencies

**Package**: `dp:foundation`

Self-contained. The group ACLs reference `{{ dataset }}`, `{{ instanceSpace }}`, and `{{ schemaSpace }}`, which must match the values used by the deployed source-system and data-model modules.
