  # Create Alias and tags for timeseries and assets
 
  Uses the DM sync api to get all timeseries and assets and creates aliases, summary and tags for each object.
  The aliases are used in the entity matching process to link matched timeseries to assets. 
  The alias process is used to make it possible to generalize the entity matching process. So that the same process can be used for different sites/assets/facilities.
  
  Default configuration is provided as part of the deployment, but can be overwritten 
  by configuration provided in configuration section below
 
  
  ```
   debug -  write DEBUG messages and only process one file if True
   debugTimeseries - if debug is True, process only this file name
   runAll - if True run on all found documents, if False only run on document not updated since last  annotation
   rawdb - Raw database where status Information is stored
   rawTableState - Raw table to store state related to process

   timeseriesView - View to to access time series
   assetView - View to to access assets

   schemaSpace - Schema space for the views, same or different for each view
   instanceSpace - Instance space ( where data is stored) for the views, same or different for each view
   externalId: External id of the view
   version: Version of the view
