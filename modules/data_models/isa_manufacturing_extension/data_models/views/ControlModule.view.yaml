    description: >
      Unique identifier for the control module entity, conforming to ISA-88 Level 1-2 control 
      hierarchy standards. A control module represents a basic regulatory or logic control element 
      that performs a single control function. The control_module_id serves as the primary key 
      and enables traceability of control logic throughout the equipment lifecycle. This identifier 
      should align with ISA-88 equipment identification standards and support integration with 
      control system documentation and engineering databases. [ISA-88 Level 1-2]

    name: Control Module Name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the control module, typically describing its control function or 
      purpose (e.g., "Temperature Control", "Level Control", "Flow Control"). The control_module_name 
      follows ISA-88 naming conventions for control modules and should be descriptive enough for 
      control engineers and operators to understand the module's function. This name is often 
      used in control system displays, documentation, and operator interfaces. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Classification of the control module according to its control function type, following ISA-88 
      control module classifications. Common control types include regulatory control (PID loops), 
      discrete control (on/off, interlock), sequence control, and logic control. The control_type 
      enables filtering and analysis by control function, supports control system design patterns, 
      and facilitates maintenance and troubleshooting activities. This classification should follow 
      standardized control type taxonomies for consistency. [ISA-88]

    name: Controller Address
    description: >
      Address or identifier of the controller or control system where the control module is 
      implemented. The controller_address provides the necessary information to locate and 
      interface with the control module within the broader control architecture. This may include 
      network addresses, PLC tags, DCS identifiers, or other addressing schemes used in industrial 
      control systems. Accurate controller addressing is essential for system integration, 
      diagnostics, and remote monitoring of control module performance. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Reference to the EquipmentModule entity that contains or uses this control module. This 
      relationship establishes the ISA-88 hierarchical structure where control modules are 
      components of equipment modules. The equipment_module relationship enables navigation from 
      control logic to equipment functionality, supporting equipment-level control analysis and 
      maintenance activities. This relationship is essential for understanding how control 
      modules contribute to equipment module operations. [ISA-88]
