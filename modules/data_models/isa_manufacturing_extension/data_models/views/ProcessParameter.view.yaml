      Unique identifier for the process parameter entity, conforming to ISA-88 recipe parameter 
      standards. A process parameter represents a parameter defined in a recipe or procedure that 
      needs to be controlled or monitored during batch execution. The process_parameter_id serves 
      as the primary key and enables traceability of process parameters throughout the recipe 
      lifecycle. This identifier is critical for parameter tracking, recipe version control, and 
      process analysis. [ISA-88]

    name: name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the process parameter, typically describing the parameter's purpose 
      or measurement (e.g., "Temperature", "Pressure", "Flow Rate", "pH", "Agitation Speed"). 
      The name follows ISA-88 parameter naming conventions and should be descriptive enough for 
      process engineers and operators to understand the parameter's function. This name is often 
      used in control system displays, batch records, and operational documentation. [ISA-88]

      externalId: ProcessParameter
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: unit_of_measure
    name: unit_of_measure
    description: >
      The unit of measure for the process parameter value, conforming to standard unit of measure 
      conventions (e.g., "°C", "bar", "L/min", "pH", "rpm"). The unit_of_measure provides the 
      dimensional context for parameter values, enabling proper parameter calculations and 
      conversions. This field should follow standardized unit naming conventions (e.g., ISO 80000, 
      SI units) to ensure consistency and interoperability across systems and organizations. [ISA-88]
  target_value:

      externalId: ProcessParameter
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: target_value
    name: target_value
    description: >
      The target or setpoint value for the process parameter, expressed as a numeric value in 
      the specified unit_of_measure. The target_value represents the desired operating condition 
      for the parameter during batch execution. This value is critical for process control, recipe 
      execution, and setpoint compliance monitoring. The target_value should be interpreted in 
      conjunction with min_value and max_value to determine the acceptable operating range. [ISA-88]
  min_value:

      externalId: ProcessParameter
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: min_value
    name: min_value
    description: >
      The minimum acceptable value for the process parameter, expressed as a numeric value in the 
      specified unit_of_measure. The min_value represents the lower bound of the acceptable 
      operating range for the parameter during batch execution. This value is critical for process 
      control, alarm limits, and quality assurance. Values below min_value may trigger alarms or 
      indicate out-of-specification conditions. [ISA-88]
  max_value:
    container:
      space: {{ isaSchemaSpace }}
      externalId: ProcessParameter
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: max_value
    name: max_value
    description: >
      The maximum acceptable value for the process parameter, expressed as a numeric value in the 
      specified unit_of_measure. The max_value represents the upper bound of the acceptable 
      operating range for the parameter during batch execution. This value is critical for process 
      control, alarm limits, and quality assurance. Values above max_value may trigger alarms or 
      indicate out-of-specification conditions. [ISA-88]

      Reverse relationship collection of all Phase entities that are associated with this process parameter. Phases 
      represent the lowest level procedural elements in ISA-88 that perform specific processing activities. This relationship enables 
      navigation from process parameter to phase level, supporting phase-level production planning analysis and 
      production tracking. This relationship is essential for ISA-88 production tracking, where process parameters are used to track phases. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the ProductSegment entities that are associated with this process parameter, establishing 
      the relationship between process parameters and product segments. Product segments represent segments for product activities 
      and resource allocation. This relationship enables navigation from process parameter to product segment level, supporting 
      product segment-level production planning analysis and production tracking. This relationship is essential for ISA-95 Level 3 
      production tracking, where process parameters are used to track product segments. [ISA-95 Level 3]
