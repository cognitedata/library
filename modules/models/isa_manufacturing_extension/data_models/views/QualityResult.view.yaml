    name: Quality Result ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the quality result entity, conforming to ISA-95 Level 3 quality 
      management standards. A quality result represents quality test results and analytical data 
      for materials and batches. The quality_result_id serves as the primary key and enables 
      consistent tracking across all quality operations, from test initiation through result 
      recording to quality release decisions. This identifier is critical for quality control, 
      regulatory compliance, and quality assurance processes. [ISA-95 Level 3]

      space: {{ isaSchemaSpace }}
      externalId: QualityResult
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: test_name
    name: Test Name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the quality test, typically describing the test type or measurement 
      (e.g., "pH Test", "Viscosity Test", "Purity Test", "Microbial Count"). The test_name follows 
      ISA-95 quality test naming conventions and should be descriptive enough for quality personnel 
      to identify the test's purpose. This name is often used in quality control systems, test 
      records, and regulatory documentation. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    name: Test Method
    description: >
      Reference to the standard test method or procedure used to perform the quality test, enabling 
      test method traceability and compliance verification. The test_method may reference 
      standardized test methods (e.g., ASTM, ISO, USP) or internal test procedures. This field 
      is critical for regulatory compliance, test reproducibility, and quality assurance. The 
      test_method should align with quality management system documentation. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    name: Batch
    description: >
      Reference to the Batch entity that this quality result is associated with, establishing the 
      relationship between quality results and batch execution. The batch relationship enables 
      navigation from quality result to batch level, supporting batch-level quality analysis and 
      batch release decisions. This relationship is essential for batch quality tracking and 
      regulatory compliance in batch manufacturing. [ISA-88, ISA-95 Level 3]

      Reference to the MaterialLot entity that this quality result is associated with, establishing 
      the relationship between quality results and material lots. The material_lot relationship 
      enables navigation from quality result to material lot level, supporting lot-level quality 
      analysis and material release decisions. This relationship is essential for material quality 
      tracking and regulatory compliance. [ISA-95 Level 3]

      space: {{ isaSchemaSpace }}
      externalId: QualityResult
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: result_value
    name: Result Value
    description: >
      Numeric value of the quality test result, expressed in the unit of measure specified by 
      unit_of_measure. The result_value represents the actual measured or calculated test result. 
      This value is critical for quality assessment, specification compliance analysis, and 
      quality control. The result_value should be interpreted in conjunction with specification_min 
      and specification_max to determine compliance with quality specifications. [ISA-95 Level 3]
  result_text:
    container:
      space: {{ isaSchemaSpace }}
      externalId: QualityResult
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: result_text
    name: Result Text
    description: >
      Textual value of the quality test result, used for non-numeric test results or discrete 
      outcomes (e.g., "Pass", "Fail", "Acceptable", "Unacceptable", "Within Specification"). 
      The result_text provides a human-readable representation of the test outcome when numeric 
      values are not applicable or when additional descriptive information is required. This field 
      is essential for qualitative test results and pass/fail determinations. [ISA-95 Level 3]
  unit_of_measure:

      externalId: QualityResult
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: unit_of_measure
    name: Unit of Measure
    description: >
      The unit of measure for the result_value, conforming to standard unit of measure conventions 
      (e.g., "pH", "cP", "%", "CFU/mL"). The unit_of_measure provides the dimensional context for 
      the result_value numeric value, enabling proper result interpretation and specification 
      comparisons. This field should follow standardized unit naming conventions (e.g., ISO 80000, 
      SI units) to ensure consistency and interoperability. [ISA-95 Level 3]
  specification_min:
    container:
      space: {{ isaSchemaSpace }}
      externalId: QualityResult

    name: Specification Min
    description: >
      The minimum acceptable value for the quality test result, expressed as a numeric value in 
      the specified unit_of_measure. The specification_min represents the lower bound of the 
      acceptable quality specification range. This value is critical for quality assessment and 
      specification compliance analysis. Results below specification_min indicate 
      out-of-specification conditions and may trigger quality holds or rejection. [ISA-95 Level 3]
  specification_max:
    container:
      space: {{ isaSchemaSpace }}
      externalId: QualityResult
      type: container

    name: Specification Max
    description: >
      The maximum acceptable value for the quality test result, expressed as a numeric value in 
      the specified unit_of_measure. The specification_max represents the upper bound of the 
      acceptable quality specification range. This value is critical for quality assessment and 
      specification compliance analysis. Results above specification_max indicate 
      out-of-specification conditions and may trigger quality holds or rejection. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    containerPropertyIdentifier: test_date
    name: Test Date
    description: >
      Date when the quality test was performed, enabling temporal analysis of quality data and 
      test result traceability. The test_date is critical for quality record keeping, regulatory 
      compliance, and quality trend analysis. This date enables correlation with production dates 
      and supports temporal queries for quality data analysis. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    description: >
      Reference to the Personnel entity who performed or verified the quality test, establishing 
      accountability and traceability for quality testing. The analyst relationship enables 
      navigation from quality result to personnel, supporting analyst performance analysis and 
      quality assurance. This relationship is essential for quality record keeping and regulatory 
      compliance. [ISA-95 Level 3]
