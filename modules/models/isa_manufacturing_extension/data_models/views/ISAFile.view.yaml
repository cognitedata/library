      Reverse relationship collection of all ISA Asset entities that are associated with this 
      file. The assets relationship enables navigation from file to asset hierarchy, supporting 
      asset-centric file queries and asset documentation management. This relationship follows 
      ISA-95 asset documentation standards and enables comprehensive asset documentation management, 
      supporting engineering, operations, and maintenance activities. Document organization should 
      follow ISA-95 document classification and naming conventions to ensure consistency and 
      interoperability. [ISA-95]

      Reverse relationship collection of all Equipment entities that are associated with this file. 
      Equipment represents physical equipment used in manufacturing processes according to ISA-88 
      Equipment Model. This relationship enables file-to-equipment navigation, supporting equipment 
      documentation management and equipment-related file queries. Files may include equipment 
      datasheets, operation manuals, maintenance procedures, engineering drawings, certificates, 
      and other equipment-related documentation. Document organization should follow ISA-88 equipment 
      documentation classification and naming conventions. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the ProductDefinition entity that is defined for this unit, establishing 
      the relationship between units and product definitions. The product_definition relationship enables 
      navigation from unit to product definition level, supporting product definition-level production planning analysis and 
      production tracking. This relationship is essential for understanding how product definitions are defined and executed within the unit. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    description: >
      Reverse relationship collection of all ProductRequest entities that are executed on this unit. 
      Product requests represent specific product requests for manufacturing execution at ISA-88. 
      This relationship enables unit-to-product request navigation, supporting unit utilization analysis, 
      product request sequencing, and resource allocation. Product requests link batch execution to specific 
      units, enabling unit performance and utilization analysis. [ISA-88]

      Reverse relationship collection of all ProductSegment entities that are associated with this file. 
      Product segments represent segments for product activities and resource allocation. This relationship enables 
      navigation from file to product segment level, supporting product segment-level production planning analysis and 
      production tracking. This relationship is essential for understanding how product segments are defined and executed within the file. [ISA-95 Level 3]
