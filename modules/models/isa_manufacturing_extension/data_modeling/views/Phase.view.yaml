    description: >
      Unique identifier for the phase entity, conforming to ISA-88 procedural element standards. 
      A phase represents the lowest level procedural element that performs a specific processing 
      activity. The phase_id serves as the primary key and enables traceability of phases throughout 
      the batch execution lifecycle. This identifier is critical for phase-level batch tracking, 
      recipe execution, and detailed process analysis. [ISA-88]

      externalId: Phase
      type: container
    containerPropertyIdentifier: phase_name
    name: Phase name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the phase, typically describing the specific processing activity 
      (e.g., "Heat to Temperature", "Add Material", "Hold for Time", "Transfer to Next Unit"). 
      The phase_name follows ISA-88 naming conventions for phases and should be descriptive enough 
      for process engineers and operators to understand the phase's function. This name is often 
      used in control system displays, batch records, and operational documentation. [ISA-88]

    name: Phase class
    description: >
      Classification of the phase according to its processing activity type, following ISA-88 phase 
      classifications. Common phase classes include process phases (heating, cooling, mixing, 
      reaction), transfer phases (material transfer, product transfer), and control phases 
      (waiting, holding, monitoring). The phase_class enables filtering and analysis by phase 
      function, supports recipe design patterns, and facilitates phase reuse across different 
      operations. This classification should follow standardized phase class taxonomies for 
      consistency. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Reference to the Operation entity that contains this phase, establishing the ISA-88 
      hierarchical relationship where operations contain phases. The operation relationship enables 
      navigation from phase to operation level, supporting operational-level phase analysis and 
      resource allocation. This relationship is essential for understanding how phases contribute 
      to operation execution and batch execution within specific operations. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the EquipmentModule entity that is utilized by this phase during execution, 
      establishing the ISA-88 relationship between procedural control and physical equipment. The 
      equipment_module relationship enables navigation from phase to equipment module, supporting 
      equipment utilization analysis, phase sequencing, and resource allocation. This relationship 
      links procedural control (ISA-88) to physical equipment (ISA-88 Equipment Model) and is 
      essential for understanding equipment requirements for phase execution. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the Batch entity that this phase is part of, establishing the relationship 
      between phases and batch execution. The batch relationship enables navigation from phase to 
      batch level, supporting batch-level phase analysis and execution tracking. This relationship 
      is essential for understanding how phases contribute to batch execution and enables 
      phase-level batch data analysis. [ISA-88]

    name: Sequence number
    description: >
      Numeric value indicating the order or sequence in which this phase should be executed within 
      the operation, following ISA-88 phase sequencing standards. The sequence_number enables proper 
      phase ordering and supports sequential execution logic in batch recipes. This value is 
      critical for recipe execution, phase scheduling, and process flow control. Lower sequence 
      numbers indicate earlier execution order. [ISA-88]

    name: Phase state
    description: >
      Current state of the phase execution according to ISA-88 state models. Common phase states 
      include "Idle", "Running", "Held", "Restarting", "Aborting", "Aborted", "Completing", 
      "Complete", "Archived". The phase_state provides real-time visibility into phase status and 
      enables state-based queries, reporting, and workflow automation. State transitions should 
      follow ISA-88 state model definitions to ensure consistent phase state management across the 
      manufacturing system. [ISA-88]

      Time series for the phase, typically describing the phase's purpose or time period (e.g., "100%", "50%", "25%"). The time series follows ISA-88 naming conventions and should be 
      descriptive enough for process engineers and operators to identify the time series's purpose. 
      This time series is often used in control system displays, batch records, and operational 
      documentation. [ISA-88]
