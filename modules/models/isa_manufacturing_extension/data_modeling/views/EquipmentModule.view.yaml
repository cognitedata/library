    description: >
      Unique identifier for the equipment module entity, conforming to ISA-88 Equipment Model 
      standards. An equipment module represents a functional group of equipment that can perform 
      specific processing activities. The equipment_module_id serves as the primary key and enables 
      traceability of equipment modules throughout the manufacturing lifecycle. This identifier 
      should align with ISA-88 equipment classification standards and support integration with 
      control systems and engineering databases. Equipment modules bridge physical equipment 
      and procedural control in ISA-88 batch control systems. [ISA-88]

    name: Equipment module name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the equipment module, typically describing its functional purpose 
      or processing capability (e.g., "Reactor Module", "Distillation Module", "Filtration Module"). 
      The equipment_module_name follows ISA-88 naming conventions for equipment modules and should 
      be descriptive enough for process engineers and operators to understand the module's function. 
      This name is often used in control system displays, batch recipes, and operational documentation.

    description: >
      Classification of the equipment module according to its functional class or processing 
      capability, following ISA-88 equipment module classifications. Common module classes include 
      reactor modules, separation modules, mixing modules, heating/cooling modules, and transfer 
      modules. The module_class enables filtering and analysis by equipment function, supports 
      recipe design patterns, and facilitates equipment module reuse across different processes. 
      This classification should follow standardized module class taxonomies for consistency. [ISA-88]

      that can carry out one or more processing activities. The unit relationship enables navigation 
      from equipment module to unit level, supporting unit-level equipment analysis, resource allocation, 
      and process cell organization. This relationship is essential for understanding equipment module 
      utilization within unit operations and batch execution. [ISA-88]
