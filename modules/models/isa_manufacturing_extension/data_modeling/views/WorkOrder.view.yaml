    description: >
      Unique identifier for the work order entity, conforming to ISA-95 Level 3 work management 
      standards. A work order represents a specific work instruction for manufacturing execution. 
      The work_order_id serves as the primary key and enables consistent tracking across all 
      manufacturing operations, from work order creation through execution to completion. This 
      identifier should align with work management system order numbering and support integration 
      with maintenance and production systems. [ISA-95 Level 3]

      Human-readable work order number or identifier assigned to the work order, typically used 
      for operational reference and displayed on work documents, labels, and reports. The 
      work_order_number follows ISA-95 Level 3 naming conventions and may include work order date, 
      sequence numbers, or other organizational identifiers. This number is often used in work 
      scheduling, resource allocation, and operational documentation. The work_order_number should 
      be unique within the site or production context to ensure proper identification. [ISA-95 Level 3]

      Classification of the work order according to its work type or purpose, following ISA-95 
      Level 3 work order classifications. Common work types include maintenance, repair, inspection, 
      calibration, production, and cleaning. The work_type enables filtering and analysis by work 
      function, supports work scheduling patterns, and facilitates work order management. This 
      classification should follow standardized work type taxonomies for consistency. [ISA-95 Level 3]
