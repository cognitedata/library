name: Unit
description: A collection of associated control modules and/or equipment modules and other process
  equipment in which one or more major processing activities can be conducted. Units are presumed to
  operate on only one batch at a time. Units operate relatively independently of one another. This
  term applies to both the physical equipment and the equipment entity. Examples of major processing
  activities are react, crystallize, and make a solution.

    description: >
      Unique identifier for the unit entity, conforming to ISA-88 Equipment Model standards. 
      A unit represents a basic equipment entity that can carry out one or more processing activities. 
      The unit_id serves as the primary key and enables traceability of units throughout the 
      manufacturing lifecycle. This identifier should align with ISA-88 equipment classification 
      standards and support integration with control systems and engineering databases. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Human-readable name for the unit, typically describing its processing capability or function 
      (e.g., "Reactor Unit 1", "Distillation Column A", "Mixing Unit"). The unit_name follows 
      ISA-88 naming conventions for units and should be descriptive enough for process engineers 
      and operators to understand the unit's function. This name is often used in control system 
      displays, batch recipes, and operational documentation. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Classification of the unit according to its functional class or processing capability, 
      following ISA-88 unit classifications. Common unit classes include reactor units, separation 
      units, mixing units, heating/cooling units, and transfer units. The unit_class enables 
      filtering and analysis by unit function, supports recipe design patterns, and facilitates 
      unit reuse across different processes. This classification should follow standardized unit 
      class taxonomies for consistency. [ISA-88]

    containerPropertyIdentifier: capacity
    name: Capacity
    description: >
      The maximum processing capacity or throughput of the unit, expressed as a numeric value. 
      The capacity represents the unit's design or rated capacity for processing materials, energy, 
      or products. This value is critical for production planning, batch sizing, resource 
      allocation, and capacity utilization analysis. The capacity should be interpreted in 
      conjunction with capacity_unit to determine the complete capacity specification. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      The unit of measure for the capacity value, conforming to standard unit of measure 
      conventions (e.g., "kg", "L", "m³/h", "kW"). The capacity_unit provides the dimensional 
      context for the capacity numeric value, enabling proper capacity calculations and 
      conversions. This field should follow standardized unit naming conventions (e.g., ISO 80000, 
      SI units) to ensure consistency and interoperability across systems and organizations. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the parent ProcessCell entity that contains this unit, establishing the ISA-95 
      Level 4 hierarchical relationship. The process_cell relationship enables navigation from 
      unit to process cell level and supports organizational queries across the manufacturing 
      hierarchy. This relationship follows ISA-95 parent-child location hierarchy principles, 
      ensuring proper containment relationships for functional locations within the process cell 
      boundary. [ISA-88, ISA-95 Level 4]
