    name: Operation ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the operation entity, conforming to ISA-88 procedural element 
      standards. An operation represents a procedural element that groups phases for a specific 
      processing task. The operation_id serves as the primary key and enables traceability of 
      operations throughout the batch execution lifecycle. This identifier is critical for 
      operational-level batch tracking, recipe execution, and process analysis. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Human-readable name for the operation, typically describing the processing task or function 
      (e.g., "Heating Operation", "Reaction Operation", "Separation Operation"). The operation_name 
      follows ISA-88 naming conventions for operations and should be descriptive enough for process 
      engineers and operators to understand the operation's purpose. This name is often used in 
      control system displays, batch records, and operational documentation. [ISA-88]

      relationship enables navigation from operation to unit procedure level, supporting unit-level 
      operational analysis and resource allocation. This relationship is essential for understanding 
      how operations contribute to unit procedure execution and batch execution within specific units.

      Numeric value indicating the order or sequence in which this operation should be executed 
      within the unit procedure, following ISA-88 operation sequencing standards. The sequence_number 
      enables proper operation ordering and supports sequential execution logic in batch recipes. 
      This value is critical for recipe execution, operation scheduling, and process flow control. 
      Lower sequence numbers indicate earlier execution order. [ISA-88]
