      Unique identifier for the enterprise entity, representing the top-level organizational 
      entity in the ISA-95 hierarchy. The enterprise represents the entire business enterprise 
      and serves as the root of the manufacturing hierarchy. The enterprise_id follows ISA-95 
      Level 0 organizational identification standards and enables consistent tracking across all 
      sites, areas, and manufacturing operations within the enterprise. This identifier is critical 
      for multi-enterprise systems and enterprise-level reporting and analysis. [ISA-95 Level 0]

      sector, or organizational structure. Common enterprise types include manufacturing, 
      pharmaceutical, chemical, food and beverage, and discrete manufacturing. The enterprise_type 
      enables filtering and analysis by business sector, supports industry-specific data models, 
      and facilitates cross-industry comparisons. This classification should follow standardized 
      industry classification schemes (e.g., NAICS, SIC) for consistency and interoperability.
