    name: Material Lot Name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the material lot, typically representing the material lot's common name, 
      lot number, or other identifying information. The material_lot_name follows ISA-95 material lot 
      naming conventions and should be descriptive enough for operational personnel to identify the 
      material lot. This name is often used in production orders, batch records, material specifications, 
      and operational documentation. The material_lot_name should align with material lot naming standards 
      to ensure consistency across the enterprise. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    name: Material Lot ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the material lot entity, conforming to ISA-95 Level 3 material lot 
      tracking standards. A material lot represents a specific lot or batch of a material, enabling 
      lot-level tracking and traceability. The material_lot_id serves as the primary key and enables 
      consistent lot tracking across all manufacturing operations, from material receipt through 
      production consumption to finished product shipment. This identifier is critical for regulatory 
      compliance, quality control, and material traceability in batch manufacturing processes.

      Reference to the Material entity that this lot represents, establishing the relationship 
      between the material master and specific material lots. The material relationship enables 
      navigation from lot to material master data, supporting material specification lookups, 
      quality requirements, and material handling procedures. This relationship is essential for 
      lot-level material management and traceability. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    description: >
      Human-readable lot number or identifier assigned to the material lot, typically used for 
      operational reference and displayed on material labels, certificates, and documentation. 
      The lot_number follows ISA-95 material lot naming conventions and may include production 
      date, supplier information, or other organizational identifiers. This number is often used 
      in quality control systems, material traceability, and regulatory documentation. The 
      lot_number should be unique within the material type to ensure proper identification and 
      prevent confusion. [ISA-95 Level 3]

    name: Manufacture Date
    description: >
      Date when the material lot was manufactured or produced, enabling age-based material 
      management and shelf-life tracking. The manufacture_date is critical for materials with 
      expiration dates, shelf-life requirements, or age-dependent quality characteristics. This 
      date enables calculation of material age, remaining shelf life, and supports first-in-first-out 
      (FIFO) inventory management strategies. The manufacture_date is essential for regulatory 
      compliance and quality assurance in industries with material aging requirements. [ISA-95 Level 3]

      Reverse relationship collection of all QualityResult entities associated with this material lot. 
      Quality results represent test results and analytical data for materials and batches, enabling 
      quality analysis, compliance verification, and material release decisions. This relationship 
      enables material lot-to-quality result navigation, supporting lot-level quality tracking and 
      regulatory compliance. The quality_results relationship is essential for material quality 
      tracking and regulatory compliance in batch manufacturing processes. [ISA-95 Level 3]

      Date when the material lot expires or becomes unsuitable for use, enabling expiration-based 
      material management and quality control. The expiry_date is critical for materials with 
      shelf-life limitations, stability requirements, or time-dependent quality characteristics. 
      This date enables expiration tracking, material quarantine, and supports inventory management 
      to prevent use of expired materials. The expiry_date is essential for regulatory compliance, 
      quality assurance, and safety in industries with material expiration requirements. [ISA-95 Level 3]
