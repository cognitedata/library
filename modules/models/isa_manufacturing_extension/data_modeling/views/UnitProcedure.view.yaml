    description: >
      Unique identifier for the unit procedure entity, conforming to ISA-88 procedural element 
      standards. A unit procedure represents a procedural element that defines operations for 
      a specific unit. The unit_procedure_id serves as the primary key and enables traceability 
      of unit procedures throughout the batch execution lifecycle. This identifier is critical 
      for unit-procedure-level batch tracking, recipe execution, and process analysis. [ISA-88]

    name: Unit Procedure Name
    description: >
      Human-readable name for the unit procedure, typically describing the processing task or 
      function for a specific unit (e.g., "Reaction Unit Procedure", "Distillation Unit Procedure", 
      "Transfer Unit Procedure"). The unit_procedure_name follows ISA-88 naming conventions for 
      unit procedures and should be descriptive enough for process engineers and operators to 
      understand the unit procedure's purpose. This name is often used in control system displays, 
      batch records, and operational documentation. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the Procedure entity that contains this unit procedure, establishing the ISA-88 
      hierarchical relationship where procedures contain unit procedures. The procedure relationship 
      enables navigation from unit procedure to procedure level, supporting procedural-level unit 
      procedure analysis and recipe design. This relationship is essential for understanding how 
      unit procedures contribute to procedure execution and enables unit-procedure-level recipe 
      data analysis. [ISA-88]

      Reference to the Unit entity that this unit procedure is executed on, establishing the ISA-88 
      relationship between unit procedures and equipment units. The unit relationship enables 
      navigation from unit procedure to unit level, supporting unit-level unit procedure analysis 
      and resource allocation. This relationship is essential for understanding how unit procedures 
      utilize specific units and enables unit utilization analysis. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Numeric value indicating the order or sequence in which this unit procedure should be executed 
      within the procedure, following ISA-88 unit procedure sequencing standards. The sequence_number 
      enables proper unit procedure ordering and supports sequential execution logic in batch 
      recipes. This value is critical for recipe execution, unit procedure scheduling, and process 
      flow control. Lower sequence numbers indicate earlier execution order. [ISA-88]

      Reverse relationship collection of all Operation entities that belong to this unit procedure. 
      Operations represent procedural elements that group phases for specific processing tasks. 
      This relationship enables unit-procedure-to-operation navigation, supporting detailed unit 
      procedure analysis at the operation level, including operation sequencing, duration, and 
      resource utilization. Operations provide an intermediate level of procedural granularity 
      between unit procedures and phases. [ISA-88]
