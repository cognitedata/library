description: The strategy for carrying out a process. In general, it refers to the strategy for
  making a batch within a process cell. It may also refer to a process that does not result in the
  production of product, such as a clean-in-place procedure.

    name: Procedure ID
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the procedure entity, conforming to ISA-88 procedural element 
      standards. A procedure represents the top-level procedural element that coordinates unit 
      procedures for batch execution. The procedure_id serves as the primary key and enables 
      traceability of procedures throughout the batch execution lifecycle. This identifier is 
      critical for procedural-level batch tracking, recipe execution, and process analysis. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Human-readable name for the procedure, typically describing the overall process or function 
      (e.g., "Production Procedure", "Cleaning Procedure", "Quality Check Procedure"). The 
      procedure_name follows ISA-88 naming conventions for procedures and should be descriptive 
      enough for process engineers and operators to understand the procedure's purpose. This name 
      is often used in control system displays, batch records, and operational documentation. [ISA-88]

    description: >
      Numeric value indicating the order or sequence in which this procedure should be executed 
      within the recipe, following ISA-88 procedure sequencing standards. The sequence_number 
      enables proper procedure ordering and supports sequential execution logic in batch recipes. 
      This value is critical for recipe execution, procedure scheduling, and process flow control. 
      Lower sequence numbers indicate earlier execution order. [ISA-88]

      navigation from procedure to recipe level, supporting recipe-level procedural analysis and 
      recipe design. This relationship is essential for understanding how procedures contribute to 
      recipe execution and enables procedural-level recipe data analysis. [ISA-88]

      Reverse relationship collection of all UnitProcedure entities that belong to this procedure. 
      Unit procedures represent procedural elements that define operations for specific units. This 
      relationship enables procedure-to-unit-procedure navigation, supporting detailed procedural 
      analysis at the unit procedure level, including unit procedure sequencing, duration, and 
      resource allocation. Unit procedures link procedural control to specific equipment units, 
      enabling equipment performance and utilization analysis. [ISA-88]
