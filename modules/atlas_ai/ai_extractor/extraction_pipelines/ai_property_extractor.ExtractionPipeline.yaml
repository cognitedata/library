  # AI Property Extractor

  This extraction pipeline manages the configuration and status for the AI Property Extractor function.

  ## Overview

  The AI Property Extractor uses LLM agents to extract structured property values from unstructured 
  text fields in data modeling instances. It reads a text property from instances and populates 
  other properties based on the extracted values.

  ## Configuration

  The configuration is stored in the extraction pipeline config and includes:

  ```yaml
  agent:
    externalId: <agent_external_id>  # The agent to use for text parsing
  
  view:
    space: <space>                   # Data model space
    externalId: <view_external_id>   # View external ID
    version: <version>               # View version
  
  extraction:
    textProperty: <property_name>    # Property containing text to parse
    propertiesToExtract: [...]       # List of property IDs to extract
    aiPropertyMapping: {...}         # Optional mapping from source to target properties
  
  processing:
    batchSize: <number>              # Number of instances to process per batch
    filters: {...}                   # Optional DM filters for instance selection
  ```

  ## AI Property Mapping

  The `aiPropertyMapping` allows you to write extracted values to different properties than 
  the source. For example, extracting from "description" metadata but writing to "ai_description":

  ```yaml
  aiPropertyMapping:
    description: ai_description
    title: ai_title
  ```

  ## Running the Function

  The function expects the following data:

  ```json
  {
    "logLevel": "INFO",
    "ExtractionPipelineExtId": "ep_ai_property_extractor"
  }
  ```
