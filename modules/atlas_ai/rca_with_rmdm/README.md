# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Agents Module

## Overview

The Root Cause Analysis (RCA) module provides intelligent Atlas AI agents for advanced root cause analysis capabilities in your Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) environment. This module is designed to work with the RMDM (Reliability Maintenance Data Model) v1 data model deployed in CDF.

## Dependencies

> ⚠️ **Important:** This module requires the **data_models/rmdm_v1/** module to be deployed in your CDF project **before** deploying these agents.

All agents in this module connect to and query the RMDM data model within CDF to access equipment, failure notifications, time series, and other maintenance-related data.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- You already have a Cognite Toolkit project set up locally
- Your project contains the standard `cdf.toml` file
- You have valid authentication to your target CDF environment
- **The RMDM v1 data model is already deployed** (see `data_models/rmdm_v1/`)

### Step 1: Enable External Libraries and Agents

Edit your project's `cdf.toml` and add:

```toml
[alpha_flags]
external-libraries = true
agents = true

[library.cognite]
url = "https://github.com/cognitedata/library/releases/download/latest/packages.zip"
checksum = "sha256:795a1d303af6994cff10656057238e7634ebbe1cac1a5962a5c654038a88b078"
```

This allows the Toolkit to retrieve official library packages and enables Atlas AI agent deployment.

### Step 2 (Optional but Recommended): Enable Usage Tracking

To help improve the Deployment Pack and provide insight to the Value Delivery Accelerator team, you can enable anonymous usage tracking:

```bash
cdf collect opt-in
```

This is optional, but highly recommended.

### Step 3: Add the Module

Run:

```bash
cdf modules init .
```

> **⚠️ Disclaimer**: This command will overwrite your existing modules in the current directory. Make sure to commit any changes before running this command, or use it in a fresh project directory.

This opens the interactive module selection interface.

### Step 4: Select the Atlas AI Deployment Pack

From the menu, select:

```
Atlas AI Deployment Pack: Deploy all Atlas AI modules in one package.
```

Then select **RCA with RMDM** module.

Follow the prompts. Toolkit will:

- Download the RCA agents module
- Update the Toolkit configuration
- Place the files into your project

### Step 5: Verify Folder Structure

After installation, your project should now contain:

```
modules/
    └── atlas_ai/
        └── rca_with_rmdm/
            ├── agents/
            │   ├── cause_map_agent.Agent.yaml
            │   ├── rca_agent.Agent.yaml
            │   └── ts_agent.Agent.yaml
            ├── data_sets/
            │   └── rca_resources.DataSet.yaml
            ├── files/
            │   ├── combined_cause_map.CogniteFile.yaml
            │   └── combined_cause_map.json
            ├── module.toml
            └── README.md
```

If you see this structure, the RCA agents module has been successfully added to your project.

### Step 6: Deploy to CDF

Build and deploy as usual:

```bash
cdf build
```

```bash
cdf deploy --dry-run
```

```bash
cdf deploy
```

After deployment, the RCA agents will be available in your CDF environment's Atlas AI.

## Agents

This module contains three specialized Atlas AI agents that work together to provide comprehensive root cause analysis capabilities:

### 1. Cause Map Agent (`cause_map_agent.Agent.yaml`)

The Cause Map Agent helps users generate visual cause maps for equipment failures.

**What it does:**
- Finds equipment and retrieves its latest failure notification, failure mode, and equipment class
- Generates a structured cause map showing the relationships between failure modes, failure mechanisms, root cause categories, and specific root causes
- Can work with either the latest high-priority failure notification or the most common failure mode for a piece of equipment
- Automatically builds and displays the cause map on the canvas, expanding the top 3 failure mechanisms with the highest failure rates
- Queries the RMDM data model for Equipment, FailureNotification, FailureMode, and EquipmentClass views

### 2. RCA Agent (`rca_agent.Agent.yaml`)

The RCA Agent is the main agent for conducting comprehensive root cause analysis investigations.

**What it does:**
- Guides users through a complete RCA workflow for failing equipment or assets
- Retrieves multiple types of data from the RMDM knowledge graph including:
  - Assets and their hierarchical relationships (parent, children, siblings)
  - Maintenance orders and work orders (corrective and preventive)
  - Failure notifications
  - Related documents and files (P&IDs, technical documentation)
  - Images
  - Time series metadata
- Acts as a maintenance professional and RCA expert, asking proactive follow-up questions
- Provides objective information and analysis without making assumptions or hallucinating
- Helps identify the most common failures and related patterns

### 3. Time Series Agent (`ts_agent.Agent.yaml`)

The Time Series Agent specializes in retrieving and analyzing time series data for equipment.

**What it does:**
- Retrieves time series data from the RMDM knowledge graph for assets
- Finds time series for related assets (children, siblings, or parent assets)
- Plots and visualizes time series data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Performs statistical analysis including computing averages with optional filtering
- Provides insights and recommendations based on time series analysis
- Acts as a maintenance professional and data analyst expert
- Guides users through time series analysis workflows within the industrial domain

## How It Works

All three agents connect to the RMDM data model (space: `rmdm`, version: `v1`) deployed in your CDF environment. They use various tools including:
- Knowledge graph queries to retrieve data from RMDM views
- Python code execution for complex data processing and analysis
- Document Q&A for analyzing technical documentation
- Image analysis for visual inspection
- Time series data retrieval and computation

These agents work together to provide a complete root cause analysis experience, from identifying equipment and failures, to analyzing historical data, to generating visual cause maps that help identify the root causes of equipment failures.
