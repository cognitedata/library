  # Create Alias, summary and tags for files and Assets
 
  Uses the DM sync api to get all files in the system and creates aliases, summary and tags for each file.
  The aliases are used in the annotation process to link found objects in document to other resource 
  types in CDF, making it possible to generalize the annotation process. So that the same process can be used for different sites/assets/facilities.
  
  Default configuration is provided as part of the deployment, but can be overwritten 
  by configuration provided in configuration section below
 
  
  ```
   debug -  write DEBUG messages and only process one file if True
   debugFile - if debug is True, process only this file name
   runAll - if True run on all found documents, if False only run on document not updated since last  annotation
   rawdb - Raw database where status Information is stored
   rawTableState - Raw table to store state related to process

   fileView - View to to access files
   assetView - View to to access assets

   schemaSpace - Schema space for the views, same or different for each view
   instanceSpace - Instance space ( where data is stored) for the views, same or different for each view
   externalId: External id of the view
   version: Version of the view
  
  ```
