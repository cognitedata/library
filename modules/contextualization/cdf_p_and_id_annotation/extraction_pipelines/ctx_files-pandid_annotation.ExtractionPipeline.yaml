  # Contextualization / Annotation of P&ID Documents


  The P&ID Annotation runs as a process in CDF Functions. Process triggers on new and
  updated documents using sync api.



  Extracts all tags in P&ID that matches tags from Assets and creates CDF annotations
  used for linking found objects in document to other resource types in CDF.



  Default configuration is provided as part of the deployment, but can be overwritten
  by configuration provided in configuration section below

  ```
   annotationView - View to store annotations in
   annotationJob - Job configuration for annotation

   schemaSpace - Schema space for the views, same or different for each view
   instanceSpace - Instance space ( where data is stored) for the views, same or different for each view
   externalId: External id of the view
   version: Version of the view
   searchProperty: Property to search for in the view that is used to create the annotation link, typically alias
   type: Type of the link to create in the annotation, either diagrams.FileLink or diagrams.AssetLink

   debug -  write DEBUG messages and only process one file if True
   debugFile - if debug is True, process only this file name
   runAll - if True run on all found documents, if False only run on document not updated since last  annotation
   cleanOldAnnotations - if True remove all annotations for file created by function before running the process (useful for testing different annotations Thresholds)
   rawdb - Raw database where status Information is stored
   rawTableDocTag -  Raw table to store found documents tags relationships in the P&ID
   rawTableDocDoc - Raw table to store found documents to documents relationships in the P&ID
   rawTableState - Raw table to store state related to process
   autoApprovalThreshold - Threshold for auto approval of annotations
   autoSuggestThreshold - Threshold for auto suggestion of annotations
   ```

   ## Running the process

   Provide a data block with the parameters for the process to run.

  ```
  data = {"logLevel":"INFO", "ExtractionPipelineExtId": "ep_ctx_files_LOC_SOURCE_pandid_annotation"}

  ```

  
  Available logLevels are INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, WARNING


  ExtractionPipelineExtId is the external id of the extraction pipeline to run
