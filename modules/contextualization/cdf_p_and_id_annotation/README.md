# cdf_p_and_id_annotation

The module creates a simple data pipeline for processing files from
your location. The processing here is related to the
annotation/contextualization mapping of tags in P&ID documents
to assets and files.

Key features are:

- Update of metadata and aliases for Files and Assets/Tags.
  - Configuration in extraction pipeline matching the names and structure
    of data modeling. See list examples list and description in list for
    annotation function.
  - DEBUG mode
    - Extensive logging
    - Processing one file name provided as input in configuration
  - Metadata and aliases for files
    - Using AI / LMM endpoint in CDF to generate a summary that will be used
      as a description (if no description exist for document)
    - Summary is used to generate tags – if processing diagrams are found in
      the text, the tag PID is added with other keywords as tags to the
      document metadata
    - Generation different alias versions of the file name used for matching
      between P&ID diagrams. Full file name containing version and revision
      is usually not used in the diagrams referring to other diagrams. For
      this reason aliases of the file name is created to reflect this an make
      the matching more precise.
  - Alias for Assets/Tags
    - Creating asset alias without system numbers, making matching with this
      more precise.
    - Process uses a raw table to store State, preventing processing of items
      already processed.

NOTE this code should be updated to reflect the project need for file name
and asset matching depending on naming standards in the company’s P&ID
documents

- Run P&ID annotation process
  - Configuration in extraction pipeline matching the names and structure of
    data modeling, including configuration of:
    - Instance spaces – where your data are stored
    - Schema spaces – schema definition of the used data model
    - External ID for the view/type – as your extended Cognite Asset type
    - Version of your view/type
    - Search property – within you type what you use for matching
    - Property for filtering and list of possible values, ex: list of tag values
  - DEBUG mode
    - Extensive logging
    - Processing one file name provided as input in configuration
  - Delete functionality.
    - IF updating / changing the thresholds for automatic approval/suggestions
      you should clean up and remove existing annotations.
    - Annotations removed are only related to annotations created by this
      process (i.e. annotations manually created, or by a different process
      will not be deleted)
    - Without delete – the external ID for the annotations prevent creation of
      duplicate annotations.
  - Using state store for incremental support.
    - Use sync api against data modeling for only processing new/updated files
    - Store state/cursor in RAW db/table (as provided in configuration)
  - Run ALL mode
    - Clean out status an logged status from previous runs in RAW, and process
      all P&ID files.
    - NOTE: to also clean / delete previous annotations also add:
      cleanOldAnnotations =  True in configuration
  - Annotation process
    - Optional: Use configuration for filter property to find Files and/or
      Assets
    - Use search property to match from P&ID to files and assets
    - If matching process fails on batch:
      - First retry 3 times.
      - If still failing - then try processing files individually
      - If individual processing fails, log and skip file
    - Report all matches by writing matches to a table in RAW for doc to tag
      and for doc to doc matches (db/table as configured)
    - Use threshold configuration to automatically approve or
suggest annotations
    - Create annotation in DM service
    - Log status from process to extraction pipeline log

#### Running functions locally

You may run locally:

To run `fn_dm_context_files_LOC_SOURCE_annotation`,
simply call the `handler.py` with a local `.env`file that contain env variable
for logging on to your CDF project

#### Cognite Function runtime

Using Cognite Functions to run workloads will be limited by the underlying
resources in the cloud provider functions. Hence processing many P&ID
documents will not be optimal in a CDF function since it will time
out and fail. One solution for this is to do the initial one-time job locally
and let the function deal with all new and updated files.
